Run a docker container with NLP libraries/frameworks written in Java/JVM languages, running under the traditional Java 9 (from OpenJDK or another source) or GraalVM.

Find out more about [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) from the [NLP section](https://github.com/neomatrix369/awesome-ai-ml-dl/blob/master/natural-language-processing/README.md#natural-language-processing-nlp) section.

## Goals

- Run docker container containing NLP libraries/frameworks written in Java/JVM languages
- Ability to create custom docker images (scripts & docs provided)
- Ability to debug the docker container
- Run using the traditional JDK 9 (OpenJDK or vendor specific versions)
- Run using the polyglot JVM i.e. GraalVM JDK (Community version from Oracle Labs), when running performing operations from the CLI 
- Play with and learn from with some examples for each of the libraries provided

## Scripts provided

**Scroll up to find the below provided scripts**

- [docker-runner.sh](./docker-runner.sh): can perform a number of the below actions depending on the flags passed to it:
    - runs the container and brings you to the command prompt inside the container:
    - build the docker base and language (i.e. java, clojure, kotlin, scala) specific image takes under 5 minutes to finish on a decent connection 
    - push pre-built docker images to docker hub (please pass in your own Docker username and later on enter Docker login details, see usage below)
    - a housekeeping script to remove dangling images and terminated containers (helps save some diskspace)
- [Base Dockerfile](./images/base/Dockerfile) | [Java Dockerfile](./images/java/Dockerfile): Dockerfile scripts to help build the base and language (i.e. java, clojure, kotlin, scala) specific docker image of NLP Java/JVM in an isolated environment with the necessary dependencies.
- [images folder](./images) - provided with scripts to build and the scripts included into the container for the base image and language (i.e. java, clojure, kotlin, scala) specific docker image

## Usage

**Help:**

```bash
$ ./docker-runner.sh --help

       Usage: ./docker-runner.sh --dockerUserName [docker user name]
                                 --language [language id]
                                 --detach
                                 --buildImage

                                 --help

       --dockerUserName      docker user name as on Docker Hub
                             (mandatory with build and push commands)
       --language            language id as in java, clojure, scala, etc...
       --detach              run container and detach from it,

                             GRAALVM only, default is blank which 
                             enables the traditional JDK)
                             GRAALVM is only for CLI operations
       --javaopts            sets the JAVA_OPTS environment variable
                             inside the container as it starts
       --cleanup             (command action) remove exited containers and
                             dangling images from the local repository
       --buildImage          (command action) build the docker image
       --runContainer        (command action) run the docker image as a docker container
       --pushImageToHub      (command action) push the docker image built to Docker Hub
       --help                shows the script usage help text
```

**Run the NLP Java/JVM docker container:**

```bash
$ ./docker-runner.sh --runContainer

or

$ ./docker-runner.sh --runContainer --dockerUserName [your docker user name]

or run in GraalVM mode (for CLI operations)

$ ./docker-runner.sh --runContainer --jdk "GRAALVM"

or run by switching off JVMCI flag (default: on) when running in GRAALVM mode

$ ./docker-runner.sh --javaopts "-XX:-UseJVMCINativeLibrary"
```

**Build the docker container:**

Ensure your environment has the below variable set, or set it in your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` or the relevant startup script:

```bash
export DOCKER_USER_NAME="your_docker_username"
```

You must have an account on Docker hub under the above user name.


```bash
$ ./docker-runner --buildImage

or

$ ./docker-runner --buildImage --dockerUserName "your_docker_username"

or

$ ./docker-runner --buildImage --language [language_id]
```

`[language_id]` - defaults to `java` when not provided. Accepts: `java`, `clojure`, `kotlin`, `scala`

**Push built NLP Java/JVM docker image to Docker hub:**

```bash
$ ./docker-runner --pushImageToHub

or

$ ./docker-runner --pushImageToHub --dockerUserName "your_docker_username"
```

The above will prompt the docker login name and password, before it can push your image to Docker hub (you must have an account on Docker hub).

**Docker image on Docker Hub**

Find the [NLP Java/JVM Docker Image on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/neomatrix369/nlp-java). The `docker-runner.sh --pushImageToHub` script pushes the image to the Docker hub and the `docker-runner.sh --runContainer` script runs it from the local repository. If absent, in the the local repository, it downloads this image from Docker Hub.
